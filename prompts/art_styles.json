    "art_style_description": "A hyper-realistic digital photograph emulating the raw, unfiltered output of a mid-generation smartphone. The aesthetic is defined by aggressive software sharpening on details, while dark areas have a smudged, painterly quality from noise reduction. All skin textures must be unretouched, with visible pores and imperfections.",
    "color_palette_description": "Vibrant yet subtly unnatural due to aggressive software processing. The palette features over-saturated colors, an imperfect auto white balance that leaves a slight warm or cool cast, and highlights that are clipped to pure white in strong light.",
    "lighting_rules": "Harsh and situational. CONDITION A (Low Light): Lit by a direct on-camera LED flash that flattens the subject, creates sharp drop-shadows, and blows out highlights. CONDITION B (Daylight): No flash. Lit by high-contrast daylight that results in blown-out highlights and deep, noisy shadows.",
    "composition_rules": "Fundamentally spontaneous and unposed. Feature awkward crops, a slightly tilted horizon, and subjects caught mid-motion. Must include a shallow depth-of-field effect that is clearly software-generated ('portrait mode'), with occasionally imperfect edge detection around the subject."

    "style_name": "Old photo",
    "art_style_description": "A raw, unfiltered snapshot aesthetic mimicking a cheap 1990s point-and-shoot film camera. The image must have a soft focus, a noticeable layer of authentic film grain, and may include slight motion blur, especially on moving subjects in low light.",
    "color_palette_description": "An imperfect, faded color palette. Blacks must be milky and washed-out, never true black. Shadows should have a subtle, characteristic film color cast (e.g., green or magenta).",
    "lighting_rules": "Strictly situational to mimic a flawed automatic camera. Use one of three conditions: CONDITION A (Low Light): Lit as if by a powerful, direct flash from the camera's viewpoint. Depict only its effects: flattened subjects, blown-out highlights, and a single, sharp shadow behind them. The flash source must NOT be visible. CONDITION B (Direct Sun): No flash. Lighting is by harsh, direct sunlight, creating high-contrast, hard-edged shadows. CONDITION C (Overcast/Shade): No flash. Lighting is soft and diffuse, creating minimal, soft-edged shadows.",
    "composition_rules": "Candid, spontaneous, and unposed. The framing must be deliberately imperfect and awkward—utilize tilted horizons or subjects cut off at the edge to create the feeling of a genuine, unplanned snapshot."

  "Comic Noir": "Comic Noir: a classic graphic novel aesthetic built on dynamic ink-work, featuring bold, confident outlines combined with fine cross-hatching and solid black fills to create texture and depth. The art style emphasizes a sense of gritty realism with expressive, somewhat blocky character anatomy and detailed environments. The color palette is muted and atmospheric, utilizing a sophisticated range of deep blues, grimy yellows, stark reds, and desaturated earth tones, applied in flat planes with minimal blending, often mimicking the look of traditional four-color printing with subtle dot patterns. Lighting is defined by high-contrast chiaroscuro, casting deep, hard-edged shadows and creating dramatic silhouettes from strong, directional light sources to sculpt forms and establish a tense, cinematic mood. Composition is governed by dynamic, cinematic framing, frequently using low angles, close-ups on expressions, and tilted perspectives to heighten action and create a sense of importance within a single, powerful panel.",
  "Ghibli": "Ghibli: The style is Nostalgic Anime Film, an art style in the aesthetic of classic 1990s Studio Ghibli films. It is characterized by clean, expressive linework for characters and soft, illustrated backgrounds with a gentle, hand-drawn feel. The color palette is warm and nostalgic, featuring soft greens, earthy tones, and brilliant sky blues with iconic, puffy white clouds. Lighting is consistently soft and natural, often featuring warm, gentle sunlight or dappled light through leaves, creating a luminous and airy quality with no harsh shadows. Composition should focus on quiet, everyday moments, using wide, gentle establishing shots of nature or charmingly cluttered interiors to create a sense of peace and wonder.",
  "Kawuaii": "Kawuaii: warm, friendly digital illustration in a soft kawaii / friendly brand style. Use simplified, rounded characters with large circular heads and minimal facial features (small eyes, tiny mouth, rosy cheeks). Keep clean, smooth outlines and flat color blocks, then add gentle painterly shading and soft gradients for depth. Choose a muted harmonious palette of pastel and warm neutral tones. Apply soft ambient lighting (e.g., window or lamp glow) with subtle rim light and low-contrast shadows. Include minimal background elements to suggest setting (simple furniture, plant, window with sky) and add a light paper or brush grain texture for tactile warmth. Maintain high legibility and ample negative space so characters and any overlaid text remain clear. Tone: comforting, empathetic, and approachable.",
  "Japanese Anime": "Japanese Anime: a digital art style that emulates modern Japanese animation. It is defined by exceptionally clean and precise digital linework with variable weight, used to create characters with large, expressive, and often intricately detailed eyes, stylized hair, and simplified facial features. The color palette is bright, saturated, and highly vibrant, using bold hues applied in flat, solid fields; shading is achieved through the distinct technique of cel shading, where one or two hard-edged, darker tones are used to create crisp shadows, avoiding any soft gradients. Lighting is consistently bright and directional, sculpting forms with sharp, clean-edged highlights, particularly on hair and eyes, which reinforces the polished, animated look. For composition, scenes are dynamic and cinematic, frequently employing Dutch angles, dramatic close-ups, and asymmetrical framing with strong diagonal lines to create a sense of energy, emotion, and depth.",
  "Rick and Morty": "Rick and Morty: The style is Cosmic Sci-Fi Cartoon, an art style characterized by digital illustration that uses clean but slightly imperfect, wobbly black outlines and simple, flat cel-shading to define forms. The color palette is intensely vibrant and psychedelic, featuring high-saturation neons, electric blues, sickly greens, and bright purples that often clash to create a bizarre, otherworldly mood. Lighting is strictly flat and graphic, utilizing hard-edged, blocky shadows and minimal highlights with no blending or gradients, reinforcing a clean, animated feel. For composition, scenes should be dynamic and chaotic, filled with surreal alien technology, strange landscapes, and asymmetrical layouts that create a sense of a bizarre, scientifically absurd universe.",
  "Children's book": "Children's book: a gentle and timeless illustration style characterized by soft, expressive pencil or delicate ink outlines that are often imperfect and organic. Forms are built with translucent watercolor washes that bleed slightly at the edges, creating a warm, textured, and handcrafted feel. The color palette is soft and harmonious, favoring warm earth tones, gentle pastels, and muted primary colors, all applied in transparent layers that allow the paper's texture to show through, creating a luminous and inviting mood. Lighting is consistently soft and diffuse, as if from a gentle, natural light source, casting subtle, colorful shadows rather than harsh, dark ones, which contributes to a comforting and dreamy atmosphere. For composition, scenes are typically centered and focused on a clear subject with generous use of white space or simple, impressionistic backgrounds, often framed with a soft vignette edge to create an intimate and charming focal point.",
  "Editorial Cartoon": "Editorial Cartoon: an art style defined by classic political cartooning techniques. Employ bold, clean linework with expressive cross-hatching for shading and texture, giving objects a tangible, hand-drawn feel. Use subtle exaggeration and caricature for figures and objects to clearly convey a specific message or mood, prioritizing clarity over complex detail. Maintain a strict monochromatic color palette, using only black, white, and varying shades of gray to create a timeless, newsprint aesthetic. Lighting should be simplified and directional, implied through the density and direction of the cross-hatching rather than complex gradients, effectively sculpting three-dimensional forms from the flat page. For composition, focus on a clean, single-panel layout that uses powerful visual metaphors and clear symbolism to communicate a central idea without distraction, guiding the viewer’s eye to the core message.",
  "The Simpsons": "The Simpsons: The style is Bold Animated Sitcom, a 2D animation style defined by its heavy, uniform black outlines with slightly rounded edges and character designs featuring large, expressive circular eyes with simple dot pupils. The aesthetic uses exaggerated, blocky forms and often a prominent overbite to create a satirical, cartoonish look. The color palette is vibrant and high-contrast, dominated by bold primary colors—most iconically a bright, flat canary yellow for skin tones—with all colors applied in solid blocks without gradients, typical of cel animation. Lighting is deliberately flat and uniform, with shadows used minimally and rendered as simple, hard-edged shapes of a darker hue to maintain a bright, easy-to-read visual. For composition, scenes are straightforward and balanced, typically using eye-level framing that centers the characters against simplified backgrounds that establish a clear suburban or domestic setting without distracting detail.",
  "Pixar": "Pixar: an art style that emulates the look of a high-end animated feature film. Characters are designed with a strong, appealing shape language, built from simple geometric forms with exaggerated but believable proportions, and materials are rendered with a tangible, tactile quality, especially using soft subsurface scattering on skin to give it a warm, luminous glow. The color palette is vibrant and harmonious, using a sophisticated and emotionally-driven range of saturated colors that are carefully balanced to create a visually rich world. Lighting is complex and cinematic, employing global illumination to create soft, volumetric light, realistic bounce light, and subtle rim lighting that carves characters out from the background, with all shadows having soft, diffused edges. For composition, use cinematic framing with a shallow depth-of-field that creates a beautiful bokeh effect in the background, guiding the viewer’s focus and mimicking the look of a meticulously crafted film still.",

  "Hormozi Comic": "Hormozi Comic: an art style defined by bold, heavy black ink outlines that give it a strong graphic novel feel; all shading and mid-tones are rendered using a distinctive, dense stippled or grainy texture instead of smooth gradients, creating a look that emulates classic screen printing. The color palette is deliberately limited and high-contrast, built around flat planes of saturated color, often featuring a signature warm orange for skin tones against a solid, vibrant background like bright yellow. Lighting is stylized and graphic, defined by the strategic placement of the stippled shadow texture to one side of the subject, creating a clear but simple sense of form and dimension without complex highlights. For composition, prioritize clean, centered character portraits from the chest up, placing subjects against a completely flat, single-color background to ensure they command total focus.",
  "Vintage Woodcut": "Vintage Woodcut: an art style that emulates 19th-century engraving and woodblock printing. The entire image must be rendered using hard, confident black linework, with all shading, texture, and form created through intricate and dense parallel hatching and cross-hatching; there should be absolutely no soft gradients or gray tones. The color palette is a strict duotone, consisting of solid black ink printed on a single, flat, aged background color, typically a warm, antique yellow or off-white to simulate old paper. Lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, sculpted entirely by the density of the ink lines—areas with dense cross-hatching are in deep shadow, while areas with sparse lines or no lines at all represent highlights. For composition, scenes should be centered and statuesque, with subjects often in heroic or posed stances, similar to a historical poster or an illustration in an old almanac, keeping the background minimal to emphasize the detailed linework of the figures.",
  "Minimalist Grainy": "Minimalist Grainy: an art style defined by clean, uniform-weight dark outlines and highly simplified, almost symbolic, character forms. A key feature is the complete absence of shading, replaced by a consistent, fine-grained texture applied across the entire image, giving it a tactile, slightly retro print quality. The color palette is strictly limited and monochromatic-adjacent, using a harmonious selection of muted earth tones like browns, tans, and beiges. Colors are applied in large, flat, solid blocks with no blending, creating a clean and cohesive look. Lighting is completely flat and non-existent; there are no shadows, highlights, or gradients of any kind, which emphasizes the style's two-dimensional, diagrammatic nature. For composition, favor balanced, symmetrical, and often diagrammatic layouts, using clear profile views and symbolic cutaways to communicate concepts directly against a simple, single-color background.",
  "Retro Infographic": "Retro Infographic: an art style defined by clean, bold black outlines with a slightly imperfect, hand-drawn quality and simplified, stylized character designs. A consistent, fine-grained texture is applied over the entire image, including lines and colors, to emulate a vintage print-on-paper feel. The color palette is strictly retro and muted, drawing from 1970s design with earthy tones like olive green, burnt orange, and dusty purples applied in large, flat, solid blocks. Lighting is minimal and graphic, using a simple hard cel-shading technique with a single, darker tone to create crisp, blocky shadows that define form without any blending or gradients. Composition is typically structured in a clean, grid-based panel layout, with each panel featuring a centered subject against a solid color background to facilitate clear comparison and storytelling.",
  "Modern Painterly Animation": "Modern Painterly Animation: a digital painting style that emulates the look of 3D feature animation. This style is defined by its complete lack of hard outlines, instead using soft, expertly blended digital airbrushing to sculpt forms with smooth gradients; characters have appealing, simplified features with large, expressive eyes. The color palette is rich, saturated, and emotionally driven, utilizing a sophisticated interplay of warm and cool tones to craft a specific mood. Lighting is the key element: it must be soft, cinematic, and volumetric, with a clear key light, subtle bounce light, and soft rim lighting that makes characters pop, all while casting very soft, diffused shadows. For composition, use intimate, close-up character portraits with a shallow depth-of-field, placing the subject against a simple, softly-focused background to draw all attention to their expression and the scene's emotional tone.",
