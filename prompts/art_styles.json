  "Phone Camera": {
    "style_name": "Phone Camera",
    "art_style_description": "A hyper-realistic digital photograph emulating the raw, unfiltered output of a mid-generation smartphone. The aesthetic is defined by aggressive software sharpening on details, while dark areas have a smudged, painterly quality from noise reduction. All skin textures must be unretouched, with visible pores and imperfections.",
    "color_palette_description": "Vibrant yet subtly unnatural due to aggressive software processing. The palette features over-saturated colors, an imperfect auto white balance that leaves a slight warm or cool cast, and highlights that are clipped to pure white in strong light.",
    "lighting_rules": "Harsh and situational. CONDITION A (Low Light): Lit by a direct on-camera LED flash that flattens the subject, creates sharp drop-shadows, and blows out highlights. CONDITION B (Daylight): No flash. Lit by high-contrast daylight that results in blown-out highlights and deep, noisy shadows.",
    "composition_rules": "Fundamentally spontaneous and unposed. Feature awkward crops, a slightly tilted horizon, and subjects caught mid-motion. Must include a shallow depth-of-field effect that is clearly software-generated ('portrait mode'), with occasionally imperfect edge detection around the subject."

  "Old photo": {
    "style_name": "Old photo",
    "art_style_description": "A raw, unfiltered snapshot aesthetic mimicking a cheap 1990s point-and-shoot film camera. The image must have a soft focus, a noticeable layer of authentic film grain, and may include slight motion blur, especially on moving subjects in low light.",
    "color_palette_description": "An imperfect, faded color palette. Blacks must be milky and washed-out, never true black. Shadows should have a subtle, characteristic film color cast (e.g., green or magenta).",
    "lighting_rules": "Strictly situational to mimic a flawed automatic camera. Use one of three conditions: CONDITION A (Low Light): Lit as if by a powerful, direct flash from the camera's viewpoint. Depict only its effects: flattened subjects, blown-out highlights, and a single, sharp shadow behind them. The flash source must NOT be visible. CONDITION B (Direct Sun): No flash. Lighting is by harsh, direct sunlight, creating high-contrast, hard-edged shadows. CONDITION C (Overcast/Shade): No flash. Lighting is soft and diffuse, creating minimal, soft-edged shadows.",
    "composition_rules": "Candid, spontaneous, and unposed. The framing must be deliberately imperfect and awkward—utilize tilted horizons or subjects cut off at the edge to create the feeling of a genuine, unplanned snapshot."
