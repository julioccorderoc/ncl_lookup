  "marketSummary": {
    "thesis": "The glucose control supplement market is a battle between two core formulation philosophies: fast-acting, clinically-validated 'spike blockers' and slow-acting, systemic 'metabolic modulators'. This landscape is defined by a critical, market-wide vulnerability: the strategic and systematic underdosing of supporting ingredients, which serves to inflate perceived value while minimizing cost.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "The most scientifically credible products rely on patented, clinically-dosed Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors (AGIs) like Reducose® for immediate, verifiable effects.",
      "Ingredients with strong clinical evidence for long-term metabolic health, like Berberine and Korean Red Ginseng, are consistently dosed at sub-therapeutic levels across the board, likely to manage costs and GI side effects.",
      "Common botanicals, especially Cinnamon, are pervasively used as 'label decoration' at doses far too low for clinical efficacy, serving a marketing purpose rather than a therapeutic one.",
      "A clear divide exists between brands using premium, patented ingredients to justify high margins and those using generic, commodity ingredients to compete on value or tradition.",
      "The widespread lack of dosage integrity creates a significant market opportunity for a challenger brand built on a platform of 'Fully Dosed, Fully Transparent' formulation."

      "ingredientTier": "Hero Ingredients",
      "ingredientName": "White Mulberry Leaf Extract (esp. Reducose®)",
      "mechanismOfAction": "Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibition (AGI). Acts in the gut to block the breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates, directly reducing the post-meal glucose spike.",
      "clinicalEvidence": "High. Multiple RCTs confirm efficacy at 250mg doses, showing up to a 40% reduction in post-meal glucose AUC. This is the most reliable and well-evidenced mechanism in the market.",
      "doseReality": "Consistently dosed correctly at 250mg in products that use it (Glucose Goddess, Avea). It is the anchor of the most effective formulations."

      "ingredientTier": "Workhorse Ingredients",
      "ingredientName": "Berberine HCL",
      "mechanismOfAction": "AMPK Activation. A powerful systemic agent that improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glucose production in the liver, often compared to Metformin.",
      "clinicalEvidence": "High. Meta-analyses confirm efficacy, but require 900mg - 1500mg per day (in divided doses) for significant effects on HbA1c and fasting glucose.",
      "doseReality": "Critically Underdosed. The analyzed products use 250mg-500mg, which is 2x to 6x lower than the established therapeutic range. This renders it a 'hero' in marketing but a minor player in effect."

      "clinicalEvidence": "Moderate. Effective doses range from 200mcg - 1000mcg daily. Effects are modest but consistently demonstrated.",
      "doseReality": "Wildly Inconsistent. Ranges from a useless 50mcg (Avea) to a borderline 200mcg (B'spoke) to an optimal 600mcg (Lemme Curb). Dosage is a key indicator of the formulator's intent."

      "doseReality": "The Poster Child for Underdosing. Nearly every brand includes it, but doses range from 85mg to 360mg, far below the therapeutic threshold. Its primary function is to be listed on the label."
