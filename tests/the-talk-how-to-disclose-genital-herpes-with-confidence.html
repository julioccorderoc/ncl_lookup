        <p>The moment you realize you like someone, that familiar knot tightens in your stomach. It’s not just the butterflies of a new romance; it’s the weight of the "Secret."</p>
    <p>Disclosing an STI status is one of the most nerve-wracking hurdles in modern dating. The stigma surrounding HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) often feels heavier than the diagnosis itself. But here is the truth: vulnerability is a filter. It pushes away those who aren't right for you and pulls the right ones closer.</p>
    <h2>Timing is Everything</h2>

      <figcaption>Choose a setting where silence is comfortable, like a quiet coffee on a Sunday morning.</figcaption>
    </figure>
        <p>There is no perfect timer, but there is a sweet spot. Dropping this information on the first date is usually unnecessary—you are still assessing if you even like this person. However, waiting until clothes are flying off in the heat of the moment creates pressure and breaks trust.</p>
    <p>Aim for a moment of calm intimacy. A walk in the park, a quiet coffee on a Sunday morning, or sitting on the couch after dinner. You want a setting where eye contact is easy but looking away is also an option.</p>
    <h2>The Script: Facts Over Fear</h2>
    <p>When the moment comes, keep it simple and direct. Avoid the "I have bad news" framing. You aren't confessing a crime; you are sharing a health detail.</p>
    <p>Try this approach: <em>"I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you, and because I respect you and where this is going, I want to be open. I carry the virus for genital herpes. It’s something I manage, and I take precautions to keep my partners safe. I wanted to tell you before we went any further because honesty is important to me."</em></p>

      <figcaption>Honesty builds a bridge; stating facts clearly replaces fear with trust.</figcaption>

        <h2>Navigating the Reaction</h2>
    <p>Silence is normal. They are processing. They might have questions about transmission rates or your history. Answer them calmly. If they react with immediate judgment or cruelty, remember: that is a reflection of their character, not your worth.</p>
    <p>Most of the time, you will be surprised. A mature partner often appreciates the honesty more than they fear the virus.</p>
