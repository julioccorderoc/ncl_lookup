## How to Submit Order Claims

At Flexport\*, we understand that issues like lost, delayed, or damaged orders can occasionally occur.

This guide explains the types of claims supported, the submission process, and what to expect.

*   **Order Delivered Damaged**: Your customer reports that the product(s) arrived damaged.
*   **Missing Product**: Your customer reports that a product is missing from the package they received. (_Not eligible for Parcel only merchants_)

*   Damaged orders

### **How to Submit Order Claims**

To file a claim with Flexport, you’ll need to provide specific documentation. Additional documents may be requested depending on the claim type.

1.  **Proof of Customer Communication** (not required for Lost in Transit claims):
    *   If a customer reports non-delivery or damaged products, merchants must provide proof of communication with the customer to support their claim, although this is not required for Lost in Transit claims. This evidence can include screenshots of emails or messages that capture the customer's concerns about non-delivery—especially if tracking indicates the order was delivered—or issues with damaged items. 
    *   Please refer to the Help Center article: [What is Flexport’s Order Claim Policy](https://support.portal.flexport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051803874-What-is-Flexport-s-Order-Claims-Policy) for further details. Proofs can be uploaded in the form of images (.jpg, .png), data tables (.csv), and documents (.pdf, .doc, .docx).
2.  **Images of the product** (if applicable)
    *   For damaged or incorrect product claims, include clear photos showing the issue.
3.  **Proof of Cost** (this includes but is not limited to):
    *   For claims involving affected items, merchants must provide proof of cost documentation and enter the exact amount on the Seller Portal claim submission page. Acceptable forms include:
        *   A wholesale/commercial invoice from your supplier or manufacturer
        *   A retail price/customer invoice from your website or sales records. 
    *   Flexport requires proof of the total cost of the items and will consider reimbursement based on the _lesser_ of two costs: 
        *   Wholesale Cost, which offers full reimbursement based on supplier/manufacturer invoices, or 
        *   Retail Value, reimbursed at 40% of the total retail value (final sale cost is considered).
    *   **Final customer invoice:** Merchants must upload a **final customer invoice** for all claims involving **DHL and USPS**—excluding those for incorrect products.Acceptable invoices need to include the following:
        *   Customer Name
        *   Customer address (matching delivery location)
        *   Total cost of product

### **Review and Reimbursement Process**

#### **Claim Review**

Once your claim is submitted:

1.  Our team will review it for approval based on the [Terms of Service](https://www.flexport.com/terms-and-conditions/distribution_fulfillment_services_terms_and_conditions/).
2.  You can track your submission in the Order Details page of your Seller Portal.

#### **Reimbursement Credits**

If approved:

*   Credits will be applied to your account and reflected on your next invoice. Any remaining credits will carry over to future invoices.
*   The claim decision will be visible in the claim window on the order page.

_Important: Claims related to removal orders, order status inquiries, returns, stockouts, or late orders should be submitted directly to our Support Team—not through the Seller Portal. Submitting these issues through the Portal may result in claim rejections. For more details, review our_ [_Removal Order Help Center article_](https://support.portal.flexport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062221493-Claims-Policy-for-Removal-Orders)_._

### **FAQs**

#### **What if my customer claims they didn’t receive their order?**

If tracking shows "Delivered" but your customer reports non-receipt, provide detailed proof of communication with your customer (e.g., emails or messages). For more details, refer to [Flexport’s Order Claim Policy](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-am-reviewing-flexport-s-help-850dk.a4StuRSubSF8431A#).

#### **How are reimbursements calculated?**

Reimbursements are based on the [Terms of Service](https://www.flexport.com/terms-and-conditions/distribution_fulfillment_services_terms_and_conditions/). Wholesale costs are reimbursed fully, while retail value is reimbursed at 40% (excluding shipping charges). We will reimburse retail value at 40% of the final sale price (excluding shipping charges) if sale price is indicated as proof of cost at the time of purchase.

#### **How long does it take to receive reimbursement credits?**

Credits are applied within 1–2 billing cycles after claim approval.

## Claims Policy for Removal Orders

Flexport allows sellers to issue removal orders for their inventory to any location within the contiguous U.S. This guide explains the claims policy for removal orders, including claim types, filing timelines, and resolution processes.

#### Filing a Removal Claim

Sellers have up to 7 calendar days from the final delivery date (30 calendar days during Peak Season, 11/15–01/15) to file a [removal claim](https://support.portal.flexport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062221493-Claims-Policy-for-Removal-Orders) with our Support Team.

_Note: This timeline differs from order claims. For more details, refer to Flexport’s_ [_Order Claims Policy._](https://support.portal.flexport.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051803874-What-is-Flexport-s-Order-Claims-Policy)

### Claim Types and Policies

#### 1. Removals to Amazon FBA or Other Fulfillment Centers

*   Flexport does not recommend issuing removals directly to Amazon FBA centers or other fulfillment centers where your team is not present.
*   Sellers who choose to send inventory directly to an Amazon warehouse do so at their own risk.
    *   Flexport is not responsible for non-compliance fees related to packaging.
    *   Claims cannot be filed for removal orders marked as delivered but not found at the destination.

*Important: All removal orders routed directly to Amazon FBA or other fulfillment centers are considered “ship at own risk.” Sellers waive their right to file claims for these shipments once they are marked as delivered.*

#### 2. Short-Ships

Short-ships occur when fewer units are sent than originally ordered in the removal request. This may appear in your Seller Portal as a Partial Stockout.

*   Common causes include:
    *   Errors during initial inbounding (miscounting inventory).
    *   Separate issues related to inventory counts requiring investigation.

If this occurs:

*   Create a support case in your Seller Portal.
*   Our team will investigate with the fulfillment center.  

#### 3. No Tracking Movement

If a removal order is stuck or damaged in transit and shows no carrier movement for 7 calendar days:

*   Create a Support case with our team.
*   Flexport will contact the carrier to inquire about the shipment status.

If the carrier considers the package lost:

*   Flexport will reimburse the wholesale value of the units sent and file a claim on your behalf.  

#### 4. Delivered but Lost

If removal orders are marked as delivered but cannot be located by the recipient:

* Contact Flexport within 7 calendar days of the delivery date.

If Flexport provides Proof of Delivery (POD) verifying that the shipment was sent to the correct location:

* The claim will not be honored.  

#### 5. Delivered Damaged

If removal orders are delivered damaged:

*   Contact Flexport within 7 calendar days of delivery.
*   Provide valid documentation, including:
    *   Signed Proof of Delivery noting damage.
    *   Proof of individual products damaged (e.g., photos).

If sufficient evidence is provided, Flexport will honor the claim.

#### 2. Orders Lost in Transit

If an order’s tracking status remains inactive for seven (7) calendar days (12 calendar days during peak seasons), it may be considered "Lost in Transit." For international orders, this period is 21 calendar days.

2.  Submit the proof of cost of the lost product(s)

If the order is confirmed to be lost, Flexport will credit you in line with the [Terms of Service](https://www.flexport.com/terms-and-conditions/distribution_fulfillment_services_terms_and_conditions/). Credits may be reversed (retracted) if the package is delivered within 60 days of claim approval.

_Note: For international orders meeting these criteria, submit a_ [_Support ticket_](https://support.deliverr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) _if unable to file directly through the Seller Portal._

    *   File a claim through the Seller Portal, including documentation for the Proof of Cost and Customer Communication.
